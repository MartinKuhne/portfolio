# Build a scalable, multi-tier C#, ASP.NET Core service with Restful APIs for an e-commerce platform.

## Features to include

* APIs that allow search, filter, and show results for products in product catalog  
* Admin APIs for managing products
* APIs to support shopping cart functionality with session-based storage
* Use a layered architecture (e.g., Controller, Service, Repository).
* Implement caching for frequently accessed data (e.g., product catalog) using in-memory caching.
* Use SQL database
* Use Entity Framework Core to interact with databases
* Create a middleware component that logs the request and response details (e.g., headers, status codes, execution time).
* Use dependency injection to inject a custom service (e.g., ILoggingService) into the middleware.
* Demonstrate the use of scoped, transient, and singleton lifetimes for services in the application.
* Add unit tests, mock data, for the middleware and service
* Implement pagination for endpoints as applicable
* Include proper error handling, logging, and input validation

## Bonus

* Add JWT-based authentication and authorization
* Integrate a third-party payment gateway (mock implementation is fine)
* Containerize the service via Docker
* Deploy the service to AWS cloud and if deploying is not possible, providing code to deploy the service to AWS cloud platform is good or provide the details of the services youâ€™ll * * deploy each of the code components to
* Include time complexity and space complexity for each of the APIs as comments in the code

* Create a github repository and check-in all files including executables/read-me and include the corresponding github link in the email
* Instructions on how to access the application and run the code
* A short explanation of your code and any choices you made in the design or methods
* Details on any assumptions you have made in order to complete the work and remain unblocked without further assistance from me
